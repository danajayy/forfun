				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Hello! For formal purposes, my name is Dana Jessica Joaquin but I mostly go by Dana (or Dana Joaquin on papers.) I am an engineer and an artist as both the sciences and the arts are my two life passions.</p>
				
				<p>I am recent a graduate from Temple University's College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Bioelectronics. During my last semester in college, I rekindled my love for webpage designing (started in 6th grade) by attending numerous hackathons and dabbling in the mobile application developing realm. Now with these newfound interests and a rekindling of one, I am an aspiring front-end developer! I am currently taking the front-end developing track on CodeAcademy Pro as it was my graduation present to myself (and I have been addicted to it ever since!) This webpage is made from scratch in HTML5/CSS3 as I am currently practicing these two languages.</p>
				
				<p>In addition to being an engineer and aspiring front-end developer, I am also a freelance artist and have been selling artwork since 7th grade. A bunch of my best works can be seen in my art portfolio (link on the side) and some of my pieces have been turned into official merchandise too. I mostly do digital paintings but at times I do traditional artwork as well. My digital mediums are Photoshop CS5 and Paint Tool Sai and my draw with Wacom's Bamboo Fun tablet. For traditional artwork, I normally use charcoal, colored pencils, drawing pencils, and watercolor paint.</p>
				
				<p>So far, I love front-end developing since that is where I can combine both my love of science and art together because achieving a life where I can be both at the same time is my all-time life goal. I am very passionate about both fields and I strongly advocate STEAM and support people who also share the same views.</p>
				
				<p>In the future, I plan on going back to school mostly likely for an MS in computer science and definitely an MFA in illustration.</p>
				
				<p>One random fact: I am an avid corgi lover! They make my life really happy!</p>
