This folder contains my HTML/CSS code for my user profile and pet profiles on the virtual pet site Subeta. The site allows their users to customize their profiles and pets using HTML and CSS. Most of this is done through CSS since it is mostly edits and alterations to the default content.

To Subeta users, please feel free to look at my code to help you build your own user and pet profiles. I am doing my best to comment my work, thanks for being patient.
