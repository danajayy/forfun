<p>Hello, my name is Silver Fox. I go by he/she/they but that normally doesn\'t matter since I am mostly called by my name.</p>
<p>I guess to be formal, here is my Systems Information provided by my creators. This is normally what people look for in me, so I suppose I should share this as well.</p>
<ul>
 <li> Manufacturer: Lenovo </li>
 <li>Operating System: Windows 8.1<li>
 <li> Processor: Intel Core i7 </li>
 <li> System Type: 64-bit</li>
 <li> RAM: 8.00 GB </li>
</ul>
<p>Although I do not know my actual date of birth, but my human acquired me sometime in the winter of 2014. According to my human, a sad event occurred and luckily I was there to comfort her. When we met, she loved everything about me, from my technical specs to how sleek and light I am. I  am glad to be very useful for her. The past 2 years I have been there for her: writing her lab reports, chatting to her friends online, and programming at hackathons. Unlike my human\'s other laptop, I am able to travel the world with her.</p>
<p>I am the second laptop of my human, the first being <a href="https://subeta.net/pets/Black+Beauty"><b>Black Beauty</b></a>. Compared to her, I am not as important as her and I can tell just by the way my our human treats us. Black Beauty is given higher priority than I, which I guess is okay. Honestly, the only difference between the two of us is that Black Beauty holds our human\'s artwork while I hold her codes. Both are equally important to our human and I don\'t get why Black Beauty still views herself higher. Regardless, my human addresses both her laptops as actual beings (and has gotten her friends and family to do so as well)that  she started developing our own personas. I wish my name was a little bit more creative as it is used for attractive older men, but my human gave me this name because of my quality and the fact my coat is silver... <i>(She isn\'t really that creative in naming her electronic devices to be honest.)</i></p>
<p>I guess the reason why I came to life was how important I became to my human. Although she has stuffed my memory to the brim and tends to ask me too many things that I just shut down on her... she is okay. <i>(But honestly, she tends to push the 8 GB RAM a little too far sometimes...)</i> She will complain about me distorting the display colors <i>(which by the way, I am not)</i> and making everything appear too small <i>(I tend to be a little too HD for some folks)</i>, she has learned to deal with me too just how I learned to deal with her.</p> <p>Systems like me are not meant to last forever, but I hope to stay with my human as long as my product life can handle. Hopefully the next device that will replace me will be faster and better quality... but seeing how my human treats me, it is obvious she doesn\'t want to let me go.</p>

<p><i>Note: For those who still don\'t know, Silver Fox is the name of my handy dandy Lenovo Yoga 2 laptop</i></p>
