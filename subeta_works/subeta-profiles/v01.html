 /*****************************************************
 *
 * 00. Section Requirements and General Information
 *
 * This section contains CSS that styles the overall profile webpage such aside
 * background image, font-type, font color, and positioning of content blocks.
 *
 * Section needed for this profile layout and the order they have to be in:
 *      Comments
 *      Basic User Info
 *      Profile
 *      Human Avatar
 *      Pets
 *      Blank Section (very important!!!!)
 *
 * Please arrange the profile sections listed above all in the left
 * column and order them as so. It is very important that they are
 * ordered this way or else the code will break/not work.
 *
 * To use this profile, please copy and paste the entire code
 * into the blank section.
 *
 * Feel free to use this code for your Subeta user profiles.
 * I will label which lines of code you can customize/change.
 *
 * Each line of code is commented explaining what they do. Please
 * feel free to use my codes to practice CSS and help you make
 * your own profiles! If want to change the value of the CSS attribute,
 * search up CSS attribute on the internet (w3schools is a good resource!!).
 *
 * Any comments and questions, contact me through sMail on Subeta.
