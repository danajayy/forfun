		<p>A mobile application project that got its official start at PennApps XIII for the sake of well...better dating! Tired of thinking about exactly where you will meet up with your date? Hate that awkward moment of who should grab the bill first? Afraid of how much you are allowed to order? Well have no fear, this app will wash those worries away.</p>

		<p>Bon AppeMeet! matches people based on their food preferences and diet! <span class="highlight">(Already one common thing between you are your date!)</span> In addition to that, it will match you and your date based on what restaurant and times you chose to go for the meet up. And not only that, it will match you and your date based on your interests so you two have something to at least talk about. Venue? Check! Time? Check! Topics to talk about? Check! But who pays the bill?! Have no fear! Right before you officially approve the meetup, you and your potential date have the option to offer to pay for the whole meal and if no one checks it off, then that means that you just have to pay for your own! 

		<span class="highlight">Basically, this app plans everything out for your meetup, all you just have to do is get there!</span></p><br>

		<h2>How does one Bon AppeMeet! ?</h2>
        
		<p>The purpose of this app is to help bring people together who actually want to go out and meet new people in person- basically the goal of this app is to promote more physical human interaction! And what better way than doing it over some good scrumptious food?</p>
		
		<p class="highlight">In our app, we call the restaurant meetups/appointments/dates/whatever you call them <em>"Eat Ups!"</em> (get the pun?)</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>How the user requests an Eat Up!</h3>
		<ol>
			<li class="step"> Pick what meal time you want to go out and eat</li>
			<ul>
				<em><li>Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Maybe midnight snack?</li></em>
			</ul>
			
			<li class="step"> Pick what time(s) you can/want to go out</li>
			<li class="step">Pick what day(s) you can go out and meet someone new!</li>
			<li class="step">Pick what restaurant you want to eat at</li>
			<li class="step"> (Optional) Customize your Eat Up to your heart's (and stomach's) content!</li>
				<ul>
					<li>It is your Eat Up too! Customize who you want to meet up with. Bon AppeMeet is aware that there are numerous diets and food restrictions, so we did all the hardwork for you so you don't have to!</li>
					<li>Customize your Eat Up by including your</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Diet</li>
							<li>Food restrictions</li>
							<li>Allergies</li>

		<h3>But I can't pay all those meals!</h3>
		<p>We understand that not everyone can go out and by a meal every single day just to go out and meet someone new, but that is where the team of Bon AppeMeet! will come through! Restaurants are a big deal for this service to work so our finance and public relations team are working close together to establish these crucial relationships with <span class="highlight">numerous restaurants (chains and locals)</span> to provide the upmost quality service to our users. Here are some restaurants we are currently working on to get those awesome discounted (and possibly free!) meal deals for you guys!</p><br>

		<p> So far, our team is targetting the bigger restaurant chains so we can have this app reach out to many areas as possible during launch. We think it be best to have this app start out with familiar restaurants for people to test out how well this app is while using restaurants they already know.</p>
		
		<p>We plan on launching this app first towards the large urban and city environments since finding restaurants and traveling to these restaurants are a lot easier.</p>
		
		<p>And why college campuses? Well, students are poor and most restaurants give college discounts to begin with. <span class="highlight">AND college students (for the most part) want to meet and make new friends (and what better way to do it than over food?)</span> Through this app, we are doing to our best to accommodate our college student users to get more benefits from our app just by being students!</p>
		
		<p>So far, the areas that Bon AppeMeet! will be launched in and tested are:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li class="step">Cities</li>
				<ul>
					<li>New York City</li>
					<li>Washington D.C.</li>
					<li>Philadelphia</li>
					<li>Baltimore</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="step">Universities/Colleges</li>
				<ul>
					<li>New York University</li>
					<li>University of Pennsylvania</li>
					<li>Drexel University</li>
					<li>Rutger's University</li>
					<li>Temple University</li>
					<li>University of Delaware</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>But why Bon AppeMeet! ?</h2>
		
        <p>Social media has made it easy to connect with anyone via internet or mobile application at anytime and anywhere. However, it makes it easier for people to quickly get virtual sexual service which is how some social websites and applications are abused for. This trend has steered serious users away from those things, making it more difficult for people who sincerely want to create new friendships or romantic relationships. Our solution to this problem is by creating a mobile app that promotes and enforces users to meet people in person at restaurants based on matched food and restaurant preferences. </p>
		
		<p>So although yes we are using mobile apps and the internet to create a new type of social media, are goal is to make an environment that brings people together who actually want to go out and meet new people <span class="highlight"><em>in person</em></span>.

			<h2><span><span class="spacer"></span>See this scene <br><span class="spacer"></span>a little <em>too</em> often?</span></h2>
		
		</div>
		
		<p>Users such as college students, young adults, professionals, and huge food lovers can use our app to meet new people by setting up meetups at restaurants while specifying if they are meeting up just to make friends or a potential relationship. Our app uses the GPS tracking system on smartphones to find local restaurants for users to plan their meetups. Restaurants who use our apps allow them to advertise and promote their business and attract users with special discounts and promotional offers. While there are dating apps such as Tinder and others that cater towards specific diets, with our app, it brings all those separate food diet dating services all in one app. And unlike Tinder, our app matches our users with the food dates already set up, in addition to possible meal discounts and deals.
