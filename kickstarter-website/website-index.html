        <h2 id="content">What is Bon AppeMeet! ?</h2>
		
		<p>A mobile application project that got its official start at PennApps XIII for the sake of well...better socializing and dating! Tired of figuring out where to eat? Hate that awkward moment of who should grab the bill first? Afraid of how much you are allowed to order? Well have no fear, with our app we hope to wash those worries away.</p>
		
		<p>Bon AppeMeet! is a mobile application that provides a different type of social media - <span class="highlight">a social media that promotes and encourages the users to go out and meet with other people who also want to go out and meet new people!</span> We want this app to create an environment of those who honestly want to meet others, make new friends, and have in-person interactions, and we want our app to help facilitate that!</p> 
		
		<p>We have our users going out and meeting people through the <span class="highlight">magic of dining</span> because who does not like food nowadays? Sharing a meal together is one way to gather people together, socialize, and make new friends!</p>
		
		<p>Bon AppeMeet! matches people based on their food preferences and diet! <span class="highlight">(Already one common thing between you are your matchup!)</span> We want our app to be utilized also as a dating app. It will match you and your matched party based on what restaurant and times you chose to go for the meet up. And not only that, it will match you and the other party based on your interests so you two have something to at least talk about. Venue? Check! Time? Check! Topics to talk about? Check! But who pays the bill?! Have no fear! Right before you officially approve the meetup, you and your potential date/friend have the option to offer to pay for the whole meal and if no one checks it off, then that means that you just have to pay for your own!</p>

		<p><span class="highlight">Either you are looking for a potential date or just want to make new friends, Bon AppeMeet! will help you find those people! Basically, this app plans everything out for your meetup, all you just have to do is get there!</span></p>

		<h2>How does one Bon AppeMeet! ?</h2>
        
		<p>The purpose of this app is to help bring people together who actually want to go out and meet new people in person- basically the goal of this app is to promote more physical human interaction! And what better way than doing it over some good scrumptious food?</p>
		
		<p class="highlight">In our app, we call the restaurant meetups/appointments/dates/whatever you call them <em>"Eat Ups!"</em> (get the pun?)</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>How the user requests an Eat Up!</h3>
		<ol>
			<li class="step"> Pick what meal time you want to go out and eat</li>
			<ul>
				<em><li>Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Maybe midnight snack?</li></em>
			</ul>
			
			<li class="step"> Pick what time(s) you can/want to go out</li>
			<li class="step">Pick what day(s) you can go out and meet someone new!</li>
			<li class="step">Pick what restaurant you want to eat at</li>
			<li class="step"> (Optional) Purpose of the Eat Up</li>
			<ul>
				<li>To make friends? A date? Or just want company while eating?</li>
			</ul>
			<li class="step"> (Optional) Customize your Eat Up to your heart's (and stomach's) content!</li>
				<ul>
					<li>It is your Eat Up too! Customize who you want to meet up with. Bon AppeMeet is aware that there are numerous diets and food restrictions, so we did all the hardwork for you so you don't have to!</li>
					<li>Customize your Eat Up by including your</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Diet</li>
							<li>Food restrictions</li>
							<li>Allergies</li>
							<li>Cuisine preference</li>
							<li>Offer to pay for meal?</li>
						</ul>

		From there, users can decide to approve or reject their pending matches. If a user does approve an Eat Up and is also confirmed by the other party, the Eat Up is made official and is set up. Anytime prior to the scheduled Eat Up, users can <span class="highlight">send premade messages to the other party, up to 5 personal messages, a late notice, or a cancellation notification.</span></p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Premade messages:</strong> We want to ensure that mostly all of the actual talking and interacting is done in person. These premade messages are mostly to notify the other user simples things like what the user will be wearing to the meetup.</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">5 personal messages:</strong> Customization is key and people like to customize. Maybe none of the premade messages will express what you are saying, so we give all users up to 5 personal messages to each matchup they confirm. In addition, this messaging system can be a safe way to communicate with the other party if a user is not comfortable sharing personal information.</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Late Notice:</strong> Got stuck in traffic on the way to the restaurant? The meeting ran a little longer than expected? Accidents happen, just make sure to notify the other party if you are running late. It's always nice to be polite. This function is to notify your matchup you are running late but are still meeting up.</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Cancellation notice:</strong> A family member suddenly passed away? Someone in the hospital? Or stuck in a situation that you cannot get out of? Life happens and we understand not everyone can be prepared for the unexpected. Similar function to the late notice but this will tell your matchup that you cannot go at all to the Eat Up.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here are some current concept pictures and prototypes from our developing team so far. <span class="highlight">Check it out yourself</span> We have our app currently being made and designed for both iOS and Android phones.</p>

		<p>We understand that not everyone can go out and by a meal every single day just to go out and meet someone new, but that is where the team of Bon AppeMeet! will come through! Restaurants are a big deal for this service to work so our finance and public relations team are working close together to establish these crucial relationships with <span class="highlight">numerous restaurants (chains and locals)</span> to provide the upmost quality service to our users.</p>

		<p>Here are some restaurants we are currently working on to get those awesome discounted (and possibly free!) meal deals for you guys! (Some of these may look really familiar!)</p><br>

		<p>We plan on launching this app first towards the large urban and city environments since finding restaurants and traveling to these restaurants are a lot easier.</p>
		
		<p>And why college campuses? Well, students tend to claim they are poor and most restaurants give college discounts to begin with. <span class="highlight">AND college students (for the most part) want to meet and make new friends (and what better way to do it than over food?)</span> Through this app, we are doing to our best to accommodate our college student users to get more benefits from our app just by being students!</p>
		
		<p>So far, the areas that Bon AppeMeet! will be launched in and tested are:</p>
		
		<!-- table to display locations -->
		<table class="locations">
			<thead>
				<tr> <!-- headings and icons for table -->
					<th class="bold">Cities<br><img class="icon" src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/marketing-and-business-flat-icons/512/skyscraper_building_city_marketing_business_flat_icon_symbol-512.png" /></th>

		<!-- end of table locations -->
		
		<br><br>
		
		<p>So far, our team is targetting the bigger restaurant chains so we can have this app reach out to many areas as possible during launch. The schools and cities listed above, we are working hard on also getting local restaurants to become a part of our service as well! Not only do we want our app to encourage more in-person interaction, <span class="highlight">but we also want to help the community as well by promoting and advertising the local gems that are only known in their community!</span></p>
		
		<img class="icon" src="http://montanyeassociates.com/img/location-marker-flat.png" align="left" /><p>We are working hard to give the small restaurants and food venues the opportunity to show off why their food is amazing by having them in our app! Plus, such local restaurants are one-of-a-kind, which is why Bon AppeMeet! will ensure that users who are <span class="highlight">HUGE</span> foodies will have the chance to go try them out! And again, what better way to go on a food adventure and try out new food than with new friends And how will Bon AppeMeet! make sure of this? Well, our app utilizes the GPS system that is available on mostly all of the smartphones today and find any restaurants in the area that are in partnership with us!</p>

	  <!-- start of safety features container div -->
	  <div class="container">
	  <h2>Safety Features </h2>
		
		<p>Because our app encourages actual human interaction, safety is our top priority for our users. Our legal team and development team are working together to ensure that our users feel safe while using our app.<br>
		
		Here are some of our key safety features that our development team are working hard on maintaining and keeping updated. We are here to make sure that who ever you are meeting up with is accurate and that your Eat Ups are enjoyable, comfortable, and safe.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Profile Picture Verification:</strong></br> Our developing team has programmed a complex facial recognition algorithm to make sure every profile picture uploaded is of the user's face. We require the image to be either a headshot or of their bust (nothing more or less). If our algorithm detects anything that is not allowed, it will reject the image and tell the user to upload a more appropriate one. This is to ensure nothing inappropriate is being uploaded on our app! And to be extra sure that the user's profile picture is accurate, for any picture that does pass the facial recognition test, we have those profile pictures checked to see if they are images straight from google images or if there are duplicates of the image in our user database. So even though the picture is of a face, we need to make sure that it is an accurate picture. Profile pictures are always uploaded on the internet and we want to make sure that it is not one of those. We need this images to be fresh and unique!</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Arrival Verification:</strong></br> This mechanic was inspired by how Lyft and Uber drivers verify they have arrived at the pickup location, therefore all user scheduled for the Eat Up have to verify that they have arrived at the chosen restaurant. This function is to ensure that all parties know who is here and to not confuse who they are supposed to meet with.</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Lateness Rating:</strong></br> No one likes to be stood up or have to wait 20-30mins for the other party to arrive to the restaurant. This is just rude and outright inconsiderate. That is why we implemented the lateness rating which is show how late a user appears to their Eat Ups. A negative rating means that the user is mostly late to their Eat Ups while a postive rating means they are mostly on time. The lateness rating is enabled the time the Eat Up is scheduled and the user that has verified their arrival can decide what rating the other user should get. These lateness ratings can reflect how often you can be matched with other users and some benefits you can get through our app. As long as the user sends a late notice or a cancellation notification prior to the Eat Up, the user will not get penalized. Let's be fair and be considerate to everyone!</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Overall Experience Rating:</strong></br> We want to know if your Eat Up was enjoyable or not. This will help us refine our matching algorithm for our users so that they get consistently enjoyable Eat Ups. Our team is still working out whether or not our users have access to this information. Keep checking back on our website to see any updates!</li>

	  <!-- start of Why section -->
	  <div class="container"> 
		<h2>But why Bon AppeMeet! ?</h2>
		
        <p>Social media has made it easy to connect with anyone via internet or mobile application at anytime and anywhere. However, it makes it easier for people to quickly get virtual sexual service which is how some social websites and applications are abused for. This trend has steered serious users away from those things, making it more difficult for people who sincerely want to create new friendships or romantic relationships.</p>
		
		<p>After some friends experiencing this behavior and some personal experiences ourselves, the team at Bon AppeMeet! hope that our app can be the solution to this. While there are apps like Tinder, Match.com, Meetup.com and others that promote users to meet other users, they are mostly only done through the mobile phones or online instant messaging. The ease of talking through a computer screen has made communication and interaction more virtual and less physical. People still want to meet others in person, but online social media has made it harder to find such people due to how easy one can communicate through the web. Nowadays, people have to be careful to whom they are speaking to on the web because anyone can fake their identity and sometimes their intentions are not always positive.</p>
		
		<p>So although yes we are using mobile apps and the internet to create a new type of social media, are goal is to make an environment that brings people together who actually want to go out and meet new people <span class="highlight"><em>in person</em></span>.
		
		<h3>But what makes Bon AppeMeet different from other social and dating apps?</h3>
		
		<p>Food just has this sort of power to bring people together. Our aim is to get our users <span class="highlight">to go out, meet people, and get to know them through food.</span> Our app provides very little personal communication between users because we want all the actual engagement to happen <span class="highlight">all in-person at chosen restaurant</span>. </p>
		
		<p>We also really mean it when we want people to go out and meet new people that <span class="highlight">we want the restaurants to get involved!</span> Both the chains and the local ones in the community because they are a big part of this service too! By starting partnerships with our restaurant friends, we can hopefully get our users to go out more often and use our app to get special meal deals!</p>
		
		<p>Of course the restaurants get perks for being apart of our app, they get special advertisements and publicity through our app by showing our users and recommending them to try out the local restaurants. Bon AppeMeet! wants to also have the community become involved and support them as well! Our app will alert any upcoming deals in the area as well as when a new restaurant is having a grand opening! <span class="highlight">Let's support each other!</span></p>
		
		<p>And we did some research and checked out our competitors and saw what their users said they wished those competitors could improve upon. What our competitors lacked, <span class="highlight">we did our very best to answer and implement in Bon AppeMeet!</span></p> 
		
		<p>Which is why our development team worked hard to implement features such as the <span class="highlight">profile picture verification</span> by using facial recognition and searches the web to ensure the picture is not a duplicate and the <span class="highlight">lateness rating</span> to make sure users are not stood up at their Eat Ups and promote punctuality and consideration. Our team really want our users to enjoy using our app and the service it provides.</p>
		
		<p>While there are dating apps such as Tinder and others that cater towards specific diets, with our app, it brings all those separate food diet dating services all in one app. And unlike Tinder, our app <span class="highlight">matches our users with the food dates already set up</span>, in addition to possible meal discounts and deals.
		</p>

		<p>The team of Bon AppeMeet! really hope our app can bring quality human interaction through our twist of social media to our users. By using food as the medium, our mission is to get people to come together to meet and make new friends with the comfort and joy of a shared meal. The food also brings together people of the community to support their local restaurant businesses as well as the chain ones. Food has this type of magic where it brings people together. <span class="highlight">And with that magic, we want to help spread it through Bon AppeMeet!: to bring our users good food along with good company.</span></p>
